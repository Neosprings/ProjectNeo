# 🤔 What is this?

## ProjectNeo for Obsidian
![projectneo_neosprings](https://alupului.com/static/projectneo_github.png)
- Canvas preview with some styling

Is a collection of **Obsidian templates** designed for writing **walkthroughs** of Hack The Box (HTB) and TryHackMe (THM) machines. These templates aim to help penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts document their journey while solving challenges.

Pick your preference and fill them out with your own notes... **complete both, and become the one.**

# 🛠️ Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Neosprings/ProjectNeo.git
  ```
Simply, drag and drop into your Obsidian Vault folder and customize it however you like.

💡 **Tip (from [Schlop](https://github.com/schlopshow)):** If you don’t want the 1600+ files cluttering your workspace, you can **exclude a folder in Obsidian**:  

- **Settings → Files & Links → Excluded files & folders**  
- Add the folder where you store these files to keep your vault organized.
